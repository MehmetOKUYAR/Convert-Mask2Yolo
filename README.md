# Convert-Mask2Yolo
 
The purpose of these studies is to handle cases where pre-prepared and collected projects have masks used for segmentation tasks. However, with the advent of architectures like YOLO, detection processes have been confronted with different label requirements. Consequently, an image processing-based algorithm has been developed to convert mask labels to the YOLO format.

This developed algorithm transforms mask labels used in previous segmentation tasks into a format compatible with YOLO's label requirements. As a result, pre-prepared datasets can be used with YOLO-like detection-focused architectures.

In conclusion, these studies enable compatibility between various detection architectures and label formats, allowing existing datasets and projects to be utilized with a wider range of detection algorithms. This, in turn, aims to achieve more effective and efficient solutions in the fields of computer vision and object detection.
